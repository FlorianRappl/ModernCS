Modern C#
============================================================

This is the source code for examples that I use quite regularly in C# workshops / seminars
and teaching. Most files should be self-explanatory, so I do not want to waste your
precisious time on reading this.

If you have questions, concerns or want to hire me, then just write me a mail or
contact me over the medium of your choice. I always love discussing things about
C#, JavaScript, C / High Performance Computing or any other consumer app dev,
web dev or HPC programming related topic.
